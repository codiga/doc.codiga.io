Codiga integrates Slack and can automatically notify your Slack channel
when a new analysis is available.

## Features

- Notify Slack rooms when analysis is completed with a link to the latest analysis
- Support more than one slack room notification per project.

## Adding Slack to your project

First, go to your project preferences and click on the "Notifications" tab. Click on the _Add to Slack_ button.
