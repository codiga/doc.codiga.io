Codiga uses Stripe to process billing.

**Important note**: Codiga **never** stores your financial information.

## Billing Cycle

You are billed monthly for the service through your credit card.

## Changing your credit card

Update the credit card in the group that has the active subscription.

## Canceling your membership

To cancel the membership, go to your group and cancel the subscription.

## Seats

When taking a membership of groups, you buy seats, which represents
the number of users in your group. You need to buy at least enough
seats for all the users using your group project and repositories.

Seats number is checked by our system periodically. **If you have more users
than seats, you will receive an email to purchase more seats for your team.**
