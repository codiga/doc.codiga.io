The objective of Codiga is to offer a platform that should be easily integrated into your workflow.
As developers are using multiple tools, we have two objectives:

1.  **Frictionless integration**: Codiga integrates with the most popular tools so that developers can be productive on day one.
2.  **Expose data through our API**: if developers do not have all the necessary integrations, expose all data through an [API](api.md) so that they can build what they need.

The following sections of the integration part detail all existing integration of Codiga
with other platforms. The API is detailed on [a separate](api.md) page](api.md).
