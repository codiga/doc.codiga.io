## Directory view

When you click on the anaysis results, the frontend surfaces
the list of directories. For each of them, the interface
shows the number of code violations, duplicates, complex functions
and long functions.

Depending on how many violations, duplicates, complex or long
functions the directory has, the value is shown with a specific color
in the background:

- **red**: the directory/file has **significantly** more violations/duplicates/complex/long than its siblings.
- **yellow**: the directory/file has more violations/duplicates/complex/long than
  its siblings.
- **green**: the directory/file has about the sane number of violations/duplicates/complex/long than its siblings.

## File View

When users attempt to check a file, the interface surfaces the list of metrics specific to this file.

If the associated repository is on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, the content of the file is
shown and the location of the metrics is highlighted with the file content, as shown below.
