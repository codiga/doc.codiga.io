## Compatibility

The Chrome plugin works with all chrome-based browsers (Google Chrome, Brave, etc).

## How to get the Codiga Chrome Extension?

The extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codiga/dbkhkhonmelajjempmoadocgneoadjge)

## Creating a recipe

To create a recipe, select the code you want to share anywhere in Chrome, click right and select `"Create Codiga Recipe"`.

Your browser opens with the code. You just need to fill the name, description, language and keywords to create a recipe.
