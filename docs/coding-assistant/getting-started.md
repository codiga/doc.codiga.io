The Codiga coding assistant helps you create, share and import in your IDE reusable code blocks (known as code snippets).

In just entering a few words in a box, a code snippet is imported in your IDE, which makes you write safe and secure code faster.

## How it works

This is a collaborative platform. Users create code snippet and share them on the platform. Any other
developer can look for code snippets and reuse them in their IDE.

## Code snippet

A code snippet is defined on the Codiga platform and can be shared with anybody. It is defined by:

- A **name**: how you call your code snippet (e.g. `Read a CSV file`)
- A **description**, optional (e.g. `code snippet that read a CSV file from the local filesystem`)
- A set of **tags**, optional, to organize your code snippets
- A block of **reusable code** that is what is being stored on the platform and reused by other developers.
- A set of **imports**, optional, that are imports being automatically when importing the code snippet.
