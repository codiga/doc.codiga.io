A group assembles users so that they can share projects. Please see this [document](https://doc.codiga.io/docs/create-group/ "Create Group | Codiga Documentation") for more information on groups.

Unfortunately, while using Github, groups cannot be created; instead, you can use the GitHub organization as a Group in Github Integration. In that case, you need to install codiga to your GitHub organization as you are good to go. For more information on this, please refer to this [document](https://doc.codiga.io/docs/integration-github/ "document").

If you use other integrations, you can create groups without much of an issue. Refer to this [document](https://doc.codiga.io/docs/create-group/) to create a group and add users.

Now let us see how one can share your private code snippets with your selected group.

## Step 1: Go to your code snippets and select the private code snippet you want to share with your group

Follow these steps to go to your code snippets

For example, We will take the test code as the code snippet we want to share with the group.

## Step 2: Click on edit code snippet

This is where you will get an option to share code snippets among the group. You can go to this section by clicking the "Edit code snippet" button on the top right corner of your screen.

This is how a code snippet is shared among a group. Once the code snippet is shared, your group/teammates will use these code snippets in their code and projects.

You can check the shared code snippets for your group using the below steps.
