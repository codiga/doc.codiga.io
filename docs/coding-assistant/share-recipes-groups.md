A group assembles users so that they can share projects and private code snippets and cookbooks. Please see this [document](https://doc.codiga.io/docs/create-group/ "Create Group | Codiga Documentation") for more information on groups.

Unfortunately, while using Github, groups cannot be created; instead, you can use the GitHub organization as a Group in Github Integration. In that case, you need to install codiga to your GitHub organization as you are good to go. For more information on this, please refer to this [document](https://doc.codiga.io/docs/integration-github/ "document").

If you use other integrations, you can create groups without much of an issue. Refer to this [document](https://doc.codiga.io/docs/create-group/) to create a group and add users.

Now let us see how one can share your private code snippets with your selected group.
