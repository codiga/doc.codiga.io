## User types and pricing

All memberships are consistent across platforms: no matter where you signed up
you will pay the same price:

This is simple, with no hidden fee or discount. We offer an affordable product
so that all developers can benefit from our tool and develop better code.

## Engine customization

We do offer services to adapt our engine to our customer's needs. This includes
adding more analysis, supporting other version control software or just
supporting other languages or platforms.
