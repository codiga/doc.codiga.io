To use the Codiga's Static Analyzer, Rosie, a `codiga.yml` file is necessary.

This file is used to provide real-time feedback on your code within your IDE or when you push a new revision on your repository and should be located in your project root directory.

## How to create a `codiga.yml`

### Automatically

By using the [Codiga CLI](https://github.com/codiga/codiga-cli), you can have a `codiga.yml` created quickly.

If you run the following command in your terminal (at your project's root directory), it'll open an interactive menu where we can suggest languages and rulesets. A `codiga.yml` will then be created for you with your chosen rulesets it in.

```bash
npx @codiga/cli@latest ruleset-add
```

:::info

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. If you do not have Node.js, follow our [Getting Started](/docs/code-analysis/integration/cli/#getting-started) documentation or our [manual setup](#manually) below.

### Manually

If you don't want to or you're not allowed to have Node.js installed on your system, you can manually create a `codiga.yml` file too.

#### Step 1

In your project root directory, create a `codiga.yml` file.

#### Step 2

Visit the [rulesets page](https://app.codiga.io/hub/rulesets) on the Codiga Hub and search for some rulesets that fit your project.

#### Step 3

Take the names of your desired rulesets and add them to your `codiga.yml` in a `rulesets` list.

For example, let's say you found and wanted to use `my-python-ruleset` and `my-other-ruleset`. You would add them to your `codiga.yml` under `rulesets`, to make it look like the following.

```yaml
rulesets:
  - my-python-ruleset
  - my-other-ruleset
```
