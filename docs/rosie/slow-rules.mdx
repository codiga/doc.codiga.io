When designing a rule, analysis is usually really fast (few milliseconds).
However, the execution speed decreases exponentially as the size of the AST increases.

## Impact on Performance

When doing analysis in the IDE, Codiga cancels rules that take too long
to execute. Your rule should be quick to make sure its being consistently
applied to all files (small or large).

Codiga imposes a time quota for the rule execution. If a rule takes too long
to execute, it is automatically cancelled by the Codiga Virtual Machine and
potential results are discarded.

## Check your rule speed

Codiga has a benchmark that indicates how long a rule should take for a given file size.
This benchmark is run automatically for you and report the speed of your rule:

- On the [Codiga Playground](https://app.codiga.io/hub/playground), you get feedback
  on your rule speed each time you click "Run".
- On the main application, when you run all tests for a rule, the application
  shows the performance of your rule.

## Fix slow rules

There are two main guidelines to make your rule fast

### Rule #1: return early

A rule targets a specific node or pattern (with a certain name, argument name or value, etc).

Make sure you return early when the node does not qualify for the analysis.

For example, if you have a rule that reports some error for a function call of a function
called `foo`, you will check the function name and do nothing if the name is not `foo`.

Instead of checking the name of the function at the end like this.

```javascript
function visit(node, filename) {
  // a lot of work

  // this rule only applies to a function call for the function named foo
  if (node && node.functionName && node.functionName.value !== "foo") {
    return;
  }
}
```

Make sure you filter the function name very early in the rule code like below.

```javascript
function visit(node, filename) {
  // this rule only applies to a function call for the function named foo
  if (node && node.functionName && node.functionName.value !== "foo") {
    return;
  }

  // a lot of work
}
```

### Rule #2: avoid computing the same data

Make sure you compute values only once. Making the same transformation multiple
times increase your execution time significantly. If your rule do the same transformation twice
and your rule is executed on 1,000 AST nodes, it will do 2,000 operations instead of 1,000 operations.

Make sure you only compute the necessary data and do not repeat the same operations.
