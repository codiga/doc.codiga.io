```yaml
rulesets:
  - my-python-ruleset
  - my-other-ruleset
ignore:
  - my-python-ruleset:
      - rule1:
          - prefix: /path/to/file/to/ignore
      - rule2
      - rule3:
          - prefix:
              - /path1
              - /path2
server:
  - hostname: analysis.codiga.io
  - port: 443
```

## `rulesets`

The `rulesets` section provides an array of rulesets to use. `rulesets` should be available on
[the Codiga Hub](https://app.codiga.io/hub/rulesets).

## `ignore`

The `ignore` section specifies what rules should be ignored for a ruleset. Ignoring a rule is done
for the whole project or just for a prefix. The path is a path in the project.

### Ignoring specific path

The user can ignore a rule only for a given prefix in the source tree.

#### Ignoring only for a directory

```yaml
ignore:
  - my-python-ruleset:
      - rule1:
          - prefix: /path/to/file/to/ignore
```

The rule named `rule1` in `my-python-ruleset` is enabled for all the project but `/path/to/file/to/ignore`.
In other words, only `/path/to/file/to/ignore` is disabled only for `/path/to/file/to/ignore`.

#### Ignoring for the whole project

```yaml
ignore:
  - my-python-ruleset:
      - rule2
```

Here, the rule `rule2` from ruleset `my-python-ruleset` is ignored for the whole project.

#### Ignoring for multiple directories

```yaml
ignore:
  - my-python-ruleset:
      - rule3:
          - prefix:
              - /path1
              - /path2
```

Here, the rule named `rule3` in ruleset `my-python-ruleset` is disabled for `/path1` and `/path2`.

### Underlying behavior for ignore

The `ignore` section contains a list of rules to ignore. The behavior in the IDE is the following: when
sending a request to the rosie server, filter the rules that apply to the file being analyzed.

In other words, you must have a function with a signature like the one below to filter the rules you will be sending to the server.

```typescript
const filterRulesForFile = (
  filename: string!,
  rules: Rule[],
  codigaYmlConfiguration: unknown
): Rule[] => {};
```

## `server`

Specify the URL of the server to use. By default, it uses `analysis.codiga.io` to analyze all files
on the Codiga server. However, you can use your server.
