## GraphQL Types

### ApiKey type

The `ApiKey` type is returned after a request to generate an API key. This object is _only_ returned after a mutation
to get a new API key because exposure of the secret key should be limited.

```
type ApiKey {
  accessKey: String!
  secretKey: String!
}

```

### User type

The `User` object type represents all the data used to manage a user. The `accountType` member
distinguish the user type (such as `Github`, `Regular`, `Gitlab`) while the `level` distinguishes
the limits of the account (`Normal`, `Silver`, `Gold`).

You can see all projects owned by the user by using the list `ownedProjects`.

All administrative details of the user (address, company, etc.) are found in the `info` member.

If the user is a `GitHub` account, the `githubInstallationIdentifier` will contain the external GitHub app installation
identifier.

Finally, `linkedAccount` list all accounts from external providers (such as `GitHub`, `Gitlab`) linked to this account.

```
type User {
  username: String!
  accountType: AccountType!
  email: String!
  level: UserLevel!
  creationDate: String!
  ownedProjects: [Project!]!
  numberOfOwnedProjects: Long!
  info: UserInfo
  allowedNumberOfProjects: Long
  remainingAnalysisQuota: Long
  apiKey: String
  githubInstallationIdentifier: Long
  linkedAccounts: [LinkedAccount!]!
}

```

### UserInfo type

The `UserInfo` type represents all administrative data of a user. It is directly attached to the `User` type.

```
type UserInfo {
  firstname: String!
  lastname: String!
  address: String!
  city: String!
  country: String!
  heard_about: String!
  state: String!
  url: String!
  zipcode: String!
}
```

### Group type

The `GroupType` type represent a group. Similar to a user, the `GroupType` represents if this is a
group linked with another service providers (e.g. `GitHub`). Users are associated with groups through
the `members` attribute that list all members of a group.

To get the projects of the group, use the `projects` attribute.

```
type Group {
  id: Long!
  name: String!
  type: GroupType!
  state: GroupState!
  level: UserLevel!
  owner: User
  members: [GroupMembership!]!
  remainingAnalysisQuota: Long
  allowedNumberOfProjects: Long
  projects(
    howmany: Long!
    skip: Long!
  ): [Project!]!
}
```

### Group Membership type

The `GroupMembership` type represents the association between a user and a group. The `level` attribute
indicates the permission given to the user on the group.

```
type GroupMembership {
  groupId: Long!
  level: GroupMembershipLevel!
  userId: Long!
  identifier: String
  accountType: AccountType
}
```

### ExternalRepository type

The `ExternalRepository` type models a repository from a third-party vendor. This is used
to list all the repository a user or a group can access. The third party vendor type is identified
using the `kind` attribute.

```
type ExternalRepository {
  name: String!
  url: String!
  kind: AccountType!
}
```

### Analysis type

The `Analysis` object is the entrypoint to getting analysis results.

First of all, the `status` attribute indicate if an analysis was completed (`Done`) or has any issues (state `Error`).
It gives various indication on the repository revision/branch.

The `violations` attribute lets you get violations for this analysis. You can filter for a particular path
by specifying the `path` attribute when querying the `violations` attribute. You can also filter by category, severity
or languages. Make sure to use pagination mechanisms (attributes `howmany` and `skip`).

The `duplicates` attribute works similarly and expose duplicated code for this analysis. You can also filter by `path`
and need to pass pagination arguments.

The `complexFunctions` attribute works similarly.

The `techdebt` attribute gives all the information relative to the technical debt: its associated cost,
and the list of files to fix.

The `summary` attributes gives general statistics on the analysis (such as number of violation per a given severity)

The `slocs` attributes indicate the distribution of lines of code for each language.

The `tree` gives the list of files or directory with a given prefix. If you pass the prefix `src`, this attribute will return
the list of all immediate file or directory under `src` (and some violation/duplicate information stored in the `AnalysisNode`)
object. The `tree` attribute is how we surface analysis results across directories.

The `fileContent` retrieves the text content of a file. The content will be given only if the project is connected
to a repository hosted on a third-party service.

```
type Analysis {
  id: Long!
  status: AnalysisResultStatus!
  startTimestamp: Long!
  runningTimeSeconds: Long!
  revision: String
  repoUrl: String
  repoUsername: String
  repoRevision: String
  repoBranch: String
  violations(
    status: [AnalysisResultStatus!]
    languages: [LanguageEnumeration!]
    filename: String
    path: String
    howmany: Long!
    category: [ViolationCategory!]
    severity: [Long!]
    skip: Long!
  ): [Violation!]!
  duplicates(
    howmany: Long!
    skip: Long!
    filename: String
    prefix: String
  ): [Duplicate!]!
  complexFunctions(
    howmany: Long!
    skip: Long!
    filename: String
    path: String
    orderBy: ComplexFunctionSearchBy
  ): [ComplexFunction!]!
  techdebt: TechnicalDebtType!
  summary: AnalysisResultSummary!
  errors: [AnalysisErrorType!]!
  stats: [AnalysisResultStatType!]!
  slocs: Long!
  tree(prefix: String): [AnalysisNode!]!
  fileContent(path: String!): [String!]!
}
```

### Violation type

The `ViolationType` object reports all the necessary elements about a violation: its location
(complete path in the `filename` and `line` attributes, `description`, `language` and so on).

The `codeHash` provides a hash of the line of code that contains the violation.

The `uniqueIdentifier` provides a single identifier for this violation and associated code. It combines
the `codeHash` and the `rule`.

```
type Violation {
  filename: String!
  line: Long!
  description: String!
  severity: Long!
  category: ViolationCategory!
  lineCount: Long!
  language: LanguageEnumeration
  tool: String
  rule: String
  codeHash: String
  uniqueIdentifier: String!

}
```

### AnalysisCompare type

The `AnalysisCompare` objects represents a comparison between two analyses (one source and one target).
All elements (branch, revision is provided for the source and the target).

The result of the source analysis is available under the `sourceAnalysis` attribute. The result of the target
analysis is available under the `targetAnalysis` attribute. You can then freely query the results of both
the source and target at the same time.

```
type AnalysisCompare {
  id: Long!
  status: AnalysisResultStatus!
  completion_time: Long!
  tags: String
  sourceKind: ScmKind!
  sourceUrl: String!
  sourceUsername: String
  sourcePassword: String
  sourceBranch: String
  sourceRevision: String
  targetKind: ScmKind!
  targetUrl: String!
  targetUsername: String
  targetPassword: String
  targetBranch: String
  targetRevision: String
  sourceAnalysis: Analysis
  targetAnalysis: Analysis
}
```

### AnalysisDiff type

The `AnalysisDiff` type represents the difference in terms of violations, duplicates, complex and long
functions. The engine computes automatically violations/duplicates/complex/long functions being added or removed
and surface them in this object.

```
type AnalysisDiff {
  addedViolations: [Violation!]!
  removedViolations: [Violation!]!
  addedDuplicates: [FlattenedDuplicate!]!
  removedDuplicates: [FlattenedDuplicate!]!
  addedComplexFunctions: [ComplexFunction!]!
  removedComplexFunctions: [ComplexFunction!]!
  addedLongFunctions: [ComplexFunction!]!
  removedLongFunctions: [ComplexFunction!]!
}
```

### AnalysisNode type

An `AnalysisNode` provides the number of violations, duplicates, complex and long functions
for one node of the file directory. The `name` attribute if the name of the file/directory while the `fullPath`
gives the full path in the source tree. If the node is a file `isFile` is true. Otherwise, `isFile` is false.

```
type AnalysisNode {
  name: String!
  isFile: Boolean!
  fullPath: String!
  violations: Long!
  duplicates: Long!
  violationsPerLanguage: [AnalysisNodeViolationsPerLanguage!]!
  complexFunctions: Long!
  longFunctions: Long!
  totalFunctions: Long!
}
```

### AnalysisResultStatType type

The `AnalysisResultStatType` provides the number of lines for a given language (for example, 150 lines of code
of Java). It is associated with the `Analysis` object to get statistics of source code usage.

```
type AnalysisResultStatType {
  language: String!
  lines: Long!
}
```

### AnalysisNodeViolationsPerLanguage type

The `AnalysisNodeViolationsPerLanguage` provides the number of violations for a given language.

```
type AnalysisNodeViolationsPerLanguage {
  language: LanguageEnumeration!
  violations: Long!
}
```

### TechnicalDebtType type

The `TechnicalDebtType` stores all the information related to the technical debt costs.

The `score` represents the Code Quality Score and `grade` the associated grade (from A to E).

The attributes starting with `fixing` indicates the amount of time of money to fix issues.

The attributes of type `CodeDensity` reports the elements with the most issues in a given category (violation, duplicates, complex or long functions).

```

type TechnicalDebtType {
  score: Long
  grade: ProjectStatus
  fixingViolationsHours: Float!
  fixingDuplicatesHours: Float!
  fixingComplexityHours: Float!
  fixingReadabilityHours: Float!
  fixingViolationsCost: Float!
  fixingDuplicatesCost: Float!
  fixingComplexityCost: Float!
  fixingReadabilityCost: Float!
  violationsDensity: [CodeDensity!]!
  duplicatesDensity: [CodeDensity!]!
  complexFunctions: [CodeDensity!]!
  longFunctions: [CodeDensity!]!
}

}
```

### CodeDensity type

The `CodeDensity` type is used in the `TechnicalDebtType` type to show the density of violations, duplicated lines,
complex or long functions. The `filename` and `function` are optional. For example, when showing the density
of violations, it is done by file and we ignore the `function` attribute.

```
type CodeDensity {
  filename: String
  function: String
  metric: Float!
}
```

### AnalysisResultSummary type

The `AnalysisResultSummary` is what is returned with the `summary` attribute of the `Analysis` type.
This type groups all statistics for use for one analysis, either total number (such as `violations` or `violationsDesign`)
or value per sloc/lines of code (such as `violationsSecurityPerSloc`).

```
type AnalysisResultSummary {

  complexFunctions: Long!
  totalFunctions: Long!
}
```

## ComplexFunction type

The `ComplexFunction` type gives all the details of a complex function: its cyclomatic complexity
(the `complexity` attribute), filename, name of the function (`functionName` attribute), where does it start
(`lineStart` attribute) and ends (`lineEnd` attribute) in the file, the number of parameters (`nbParameters` attribute).

```
type ComplexFunction {
  complexity: Long!
  filename: String!
  functionName: String!
  length: Long!
  lineStart: Long!
  lineEnd: Long!
  nbParameters: Long!
  language: LanguageEnumeration!
}
```

### Duplicate and DuplicateOccurrence type

The `Duplicate` type represents a block of duplicate code. The `Duplicate` object itself
represent the concept of duplicated code. It indicates the length of the duplicated code (`lineCount` attribute)
and the code itself. Then, the `occurrences` attribute lists all the occurrences of this duplicates (make sure
to pass the `howmany` and `skip` attributes). An occurrence is shown using the `DuplicateOccurrence` object type.
This type contains the file containing the occurrence (attribute `filename`) as well as the line where the occurrence
occurs (attribute `line`).

```
type Duplicate {
  id: Long!
  lineCount: Long!
  code: String!
  occurrences(
    howmany: Long
    filename: String
    skip: Long
  ): [DuplicateOccurrence!]!
}

type DuplicateOccurrence {
  filename: String!
  line: Long!
}
```

### ViolationIgnore type

The `ViolationIgnore` type represents a violation that is ignored for a project. If the violation is ignored only
for a file, the attribute `filename` is defined. If the violation is ignored for the whole project, the
`filename` attribute is not defined.

```
type ViolationIgnore {
  filename: String
  description: String
  language: LanguageEnumeration
  rule: String!
  tool: String!
}
```

### FileAnalysis type

This is the type that represents the `FileAnalysis` type that represents
a single file to analyze.

```
# Analysis for a single file
type FileAnalysis {
  # identifier of the analysis
  id: Long!

  # status of the analysis
  status: AnalysisResultStatus!

  # filename
  filename: String!

  # language
  language: LanguageEnumeration!

  # running time for the analysis
  runningTimeSeconds: Long!

  # when the request was issued
  timestamp: Long!

  # code sent by the user
  code: String!

  # violation found
  violations: [FileAnalysisViolation!]!
}
```

### FileAnalysisViolation type

This represents the violations surfaced for `FileAnalysis` objects.
This violation object does not contain the `codeHash` attribute.
Other than that, the object has similar fields than the `Violation` object.

```
# violation for a one-off analysis
type FileAnalysisViolation {
  # identifier of the analysis
  id: Long!

  # language
  language: LanguageEnumeration!

  # description
  description: String!

  # severity of the error
  severity: Long!

  # category of the error
  category: ViolationCategory!

  # line where the error appears
  line: Long!

  # number of lines with the error
  lineCount: Long!

  # tool used to detect the issue
  tool: String!

  # name of the rule
  rule: String!

  # URL for recommendation
  ruleUrl: String
}
```

### Analysis Queries

#### Getting several analyses

The following request queries the project with the `id` 12. It surfaces:

- the project name
- the last two analyses (`howmany` set to 2 and `skip` to 0) that have been completed (status `Done`)

```
{
  project(id: 12){
    name
    analyses(howmany: 2, skip: 0, status: Done){
      id
      startTimestamp
      runningTimeSeconds
    }
  }
}
```
